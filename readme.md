## About

Dark inspired customizable themes for GitHub and subdomains.<br>
Includes many options to further customize your GitHub experience.

This style leverages the awesome procedural color generator designed by [vednoc](https://github.com/vednoc/)

An original fork of [dark-gihub](https://github.com/vednoc/dark-github) modified and extended heavily to fully cover
my most used subdomains for GitHub.

## What this project is not.

If you use GitHub extensions, like Gitako, ZenHub, etc. you will find NO internal support for any.<br>
This will never be added to this style, so don't ask.

Extensions support belongs to yet another repo, to make it simpler to maintain and develop.

## Installing

Stylus is required and is the only extension supported.

* Stylus - install the addon for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) and [Opera](https://addons.opera.com/en-gb/extensions/details/stylus/).

Then install this style clicking:

[![INSTALL DIRECTLY WITH - STYLUS Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install_directly_with-Stylus-21d1d0.svg?longCache=true&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/style-it-themes/dark-inspired-github/raw/main/dark-inspired-github.user.styl)
  > Only available using Stylus (see the [documentation](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Usercss)). ðŸŽ‰

### Additional Userstyles
