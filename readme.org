* Dark-GitHub
Experimental userstyle for GitHub that uses [vednoc's](https://github.com/vednoc) procedural color generator and
GitHub's native CSS variables. It is _not_ ready.

The major goal of this experimental userstyle is to improve the color generator
itself on a large website that can utilize most, if not all of its colors. By
the end, depending on where things go, this userstyle might be archived, or it
might fully replace the use of GitHub Dark for me personally.
